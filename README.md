## \[  New Professional Form Animation \]


</div>

### Description

This is a new Idea form animation I did yesterday.The effect is more professional than many others.The 'New' is that the function can automatically detect the 'Controll's position which calls the 'Form Load' the form orginates from that controll itself. The code is not so huge and the animation runs smoothly. One More - when you exicute the compiled exe, it orginates from 'it's own Icon'. You can also select the animation color. Hope you all like it. Its upto you to Vote for this code.Enjoy!.
